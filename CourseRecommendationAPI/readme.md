# Course Recommendation API

This project provides a **Course Recommendation System** that suggests similar courses based on the title of a given course. It uses **text vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to recommend courses from a dataset.

---

## Features

- **Text Vectorization**: Converts course titles into numerical vectors using `CountVectorizer`.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computes similarity scores between courses to recommend the most relevant ones.
- **Customizable Recommendations**: Allows users to specify the number of recommendations.
- **Course Metadata**: Displays additional information such as course duration, rating, and payment status.
